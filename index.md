at the [Department of Linguistics](http://sfs.uni-tuebingen.de),
[University of Tübingen](http://uni-tuebingen.de).

## Introduction

This course is a practical, broad and fast-paced introduction
to Natural Language Processing (NLP).
The course covers a variety of machine learning techniques
and their applications in NLP and computational linguistics.
The [schedule](schedule) includes for more information
on the topics and course material.

This is a 9ECTS course compulsory for the BA studies in
the [International Studies in Computational Linguistics](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities/departments/modern-languages/department-of-linguistics/courses-of-study/courses-of-study-at-the-sfs/international-studies-in-computational-linguistics/ba-programme-iscl/) (ISCL).
Master's students can take the course as a "Hauptseminar"
with additional work (a term project/paper).
The course is also open to students of other degree programs
with appropriate background.
Please contact the instructor before signing up if you are
